IPMI Hackathon
=============

This is a collection of tools, demos and a base application to build your app with.

Admin
-----

There is a admin interface available at `http://ipmi.wirelab.nl:8000/admin`.
Here you can upload apps and show them on the various installations.

Building
--------

There is a `build.sh` script provided that will bundle the app into a zip that will work with the admin interface.
For windows there is a `build.bat` provided that does the same.

For windows a working `zip.exe` is provided. on osx `zip` is standard.
On linux make sure you have a working `zip` command.


App
---

The main entrypoint for an app is [app/screens/1/index.html](app/screens/1/index.html).
The id and version of the app are specified in [app/manifest.json](app/manifest.json).

Do not edit the screen id as currently only screen `1` is in use.
Make sure you change the version if you want to publish an updated application.

Mask
----
The application on Noorderhagen is permanently covered with a mask to prevent projecting on the windows in the wall. You can get this mask here [/window-mask.svg](/window-mask.svg)

Browse requirements
-------------------

Applications will be run in the latest version of Chrome/Chromium. Therefor make sure that your application will work within this browser.
As to webtechnologies you can use anything that the latest Chrome/Chromium supports.

Motion
------

We use 'TSPS' for motion detection. TSPS access is provided with a websocket.
Documentation about the specific protocol can be found at under [/examples/documentation.html](/examples/documentation.html).

There is a proxy available for both the wirelab installation and the noorderhagen installation.
The websockets are available under the following urls.

- `http://ipmi.wirelab.nl:4000/secret/noorderhagen`
- `http://ipmi.wirelab.nl:4000/secret/wirelab`

Development server
------------------

In order to use the development server you can use the added server.js file to serve either 
the app or the examples folder of the repo.
As preparation you will need to run `npm install` in the root folder of the repository to install
the required dependencies. Once installed you can run:
* `npm start` to run your application as a server
* `npm start examples` to run the examples folder of the repository

Once the server is started you can access it through http://localhost:8081 for the app or http://localhost:8082 for the examples.

Framework documentation & examples
----------------------------------

In order to access the documentation you can run `npm start examples` in the root folder of the repository to
start a server with the example code and documentation.
